## UX Learning: Navigation Density
- **Issue**: Navigation bar was limited to 5 items, causing important tabs to be hidden on desktop.
- **Solution**: Removed the slice to show all 10 tabs, while reducing horizontal spacing (`space-x-6` to `space-x-4`) and font size (`text-body` to `text-small`) to ensure they fit within the 1400px container.
- **Result**: Improved discoverability of all site sections without compromising the layout.
